# Blues Wireless Notecard .NET Integration

## Philosophy

* Run on both desktop and embedded platforms
* Support serial and IÂ²C
* Try and stay as [.NET Standard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) compatible as possible
* When diverging, isolate it in separate assemblies
* Use Dependency Injection as appropriate
